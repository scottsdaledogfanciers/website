Written charges with specifications must be filed in duplicate with the Secretary, together with a deposit of $25.00, which shall be forfeited if such charges are not sustained by the Board of Directors following a hearing. The Secretary shall promptly send a copy of the charges to each member of the Board of Directors or present them at a Board meeting, and the Board shall first consider whether the actions alleged in the charges, if proven, might constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the Club. If the Board of Directors considers that the charges do not allege conduct, which would be prejudicial to the best interest of the Club, it may refuse to entertain jurisdiction. If the Board of Directors entertains jurisdiction of the charges, it shall fix a date of a hearing to the Board not less than three (3) weeks or more than six (6) weeks thereafter. The Secretary shall promptly send one copy of the charges to the accused member by registered mail, together with a notice of the hearing, and an assurance that the defendant may personally appear in his own defense and bring witnesses, if he or she wishes.

The Board will follow the disciplinary procedures given in their parliamentary authority to investigate any compliant prior to the hearing to determine whether to recommend that further action, including the proffering of charges, is necessary or warranted.

The steps to be followed are as follows:
1.       Confidential investigation by a committee
2.       Report of the committee and preferral of charges if warranted
3.       Formal notification of the accused
4.       Hearing
5.       Membership review of the Hearing Committee's findings.

SECTION 3.        Board Hearing.  The Board of Directors shall have com-plete authority to decide whether counsel may attend the hearing, but both complainant and defendant shall be treated uniformly in that regard. Should the charges be sustained after hearing all the evidence and testimony presented by complainant and defendant, the Board of Directors may, by a majority vote of those present, either reprimand or suspend the defendant from all privileges of the Club for not more than six months from the date of the hearing; and, if it deems that punishment insufficient, it may also recommend to the membership that the penalty be expulsion. In such case, the suspension shall not restrict the defendant's right to appear before his fellow members at the ensuing Club meeting which considers the Board of Directors' recommendation. Immediately after the Board of Directors has reached a decision, its findings shall be put in written form and filed with the Secretary. The Secretary, in turn, shall notify each of the parties of the Board of Directors decision and penalty, if any.

SECTION 4.        Expulsion. Expulsion of a member from the Club may be accomplished only at a meeting of the Club following a Board hearing, and upon the Board of Directors' recommendation as provided in Section 3 of this Article. Such proceeding may occur at a regular or special meeting of the Club to be held within sixty (60) days, but not earlier than thirty (30) days after the date of the Board of Directors' recommendation of expulsion. The defendant shall have the privilege of appearing in his own behalf, though no evidence shall be taken at this meeting. The President shall read the charges and the Board of Directors' findings and recommendation, and shall invite the defendant, if present, to speak in his own behalf, if he wishes. The members shall then vote by secret written ballot on the proposed expulsion. A two- third vote of those present and voting at the meeting shall be necessary for expulsion. If expulsion is not so voted, the Board of Directors' suspension shall stand
