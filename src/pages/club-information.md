ARTICLE II            MEMBERSHIP

SECTION 1a.                   Eligibility: There shall be five types of membership open to all persons 18 years or older who are in good standing with The American Kennel Club, and who subscribe to the purposes of this Club.

Single Membership: Enjoys all the privileges of the club including the right to vote and hold office.

Family Membership: Open to two persons who reside in the same residence. They enjoy all the privileges of the club and each individual shall have one vote.

While membership is to be unrestricted as to residence, the Club's primary purpose is to be representative of the breeders and exhibitors in its immediate area.

SECTION 1b.               Non-voting membership:

Junior Membership: Open to individuals under the age of 18 years with an interest in participating in activities of the Club.  Junior members will pay no dues.

Associate Membership: Open to individuals who do not meet the requirements for regular membership.

Honorary Membership: Bestowed on individual(s) who have provided outstanding service to the world of purebred dogs. Honorary members pay no dues.
​
SECTION 2.                    Dues. The annual dues shall be an amount as established by the Board, not to exceed $50.00 for an individual member, $75.00 for a family membership, and $50.00 for an Associate Membership. Dues are payable on or before December 31st of each year; provided, however, that new members joining during the calendar year shall pay dues for the balance of the year at the rate of one-twelfth of the annual dues per month for an individual membership, and one eighteenth per month for a family membership, but at no time shall they pay more than the regular annual dues. No member may vote whose dues are not paid for the current year. During the month of November, the Treasurer shall send to each member a statement of his dues for the ensuing year.

SECTION 3.                    Election to Membership.     Each applicant for membership shall apply on a form as approved by the Board of Directors, and which shall provide that the applicant agrees to abide by these Bylaws and the rules of The American Kennel Club. The application shall state the name, address, and occupation of the applicant, and it shall carry the endorsement of two members in good standing. Accompanying the application, the prospective member shall submit dues payment for the current year.

All applications shall be filed with the Membership Chairman for processing, after which the application will be submitted to the Secretary for presentation to the Board of Directors for its recommendation to the general membership.  At the next regular club meeting following the Board recommendation, the application will be presented to the general membership for approval. Affirmative votes of two-thirds of the members present and voting at that meeting shall be required to elect the applicant.

Applications for membership that have been rejected may not re-apply within six months after such rejection.

SECTION 4.                   Termination of Membership

Memberships may be terminated:

By Resignation. Any member in good standing may resign from the Club upon written notice to the Secretary, but no member may resign when in debt to the Club. Dues obligations are considered a debt to the Club, and they are incurred on the first day of each fiscal year.

By Lapsing.  A membership will be considered as lapsed and automatically terminated if such member's dues remain unpaid 90 days after the first day of the fiscal year; however, the Board may grant an additional 90 days of grace to such delinquent members in meritorious cases. In no case may a person be entitled to vote at any Club meeting whose dues are unpaid as of the date of that meeting.

By Expulsion. A membership may be terminated by expulsion as provided in Article VII of these Bylaws.
